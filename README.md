# APT Proxy Setup Script

## Overview

This Bash script, `setup_apt_proxy.sh`, is designed to automate the configuration of an APT proxy, update the system's APT package list, and set up a cron job to perform these tasks nightly. The script is ideal for environments where an APT proxy is used to cache package downloads to improve network efficiency.

## Features

- **APT Proxy Configuration**: Automatically sets or updates the APT proxy configuration file.
- **APT Update and Upgrade**: Updates and upgrades the APT package lists and installed packages.
- **Cron Job Setup**: Sets up a cron job to run the script every night at 01:00 to ensure the proxy configuration and package lists are always up-to-date.
- **Non-Interactive Execution**: Designed to run non-interactively, making it suitable for automated environments.

## Requirements

- **Operating System**: Linux (Debian-based distributions recommended)
- **Permissions**: The script must be run with root or sudo privileges.
- **APT Proxy**: Requires a functional APT proxy server (e.g., `apt-cacher-ng`) configured and running.

## Installation

1. **Download the Script**: Place the `setup_apt_proxy.sh` script in `/usr/local/bin/` or another directory in your `PATH`.
2. **Make the Script Executable**:
